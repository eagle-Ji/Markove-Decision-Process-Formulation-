# ðŸ¤– Microrobot Navigation using Reinforcement Learning (Soft Actor-Critic)

This project explores autonomous microrobot navigation from one point to another along a **circular path**, under the influence of a **controlled magnetic field**, using **Deep Reinforcement Learning**. It applies the **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** algorithm in a **continuous control setting** where:

- ðŸ“¸ The **state space** is image-based, representing the simulation graph (e.g., robot position on the field).
- ðŸŒ€ The **action space** controls rotation **around and along the axis** via angle **Î¦ (phi)**â€”simulating torque or field orientation.
