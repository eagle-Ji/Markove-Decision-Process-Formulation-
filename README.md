The project contains a notebook containg MDP (State, Action, reward, next state, done) signals for applying reinofrcement learning algorithms. 
Code for Soft Actor Critic Algorithm. 
Problem: "Microrobot Navigation from one point to another in a circular path under the influence of magnetic field through reinforcement learning"
